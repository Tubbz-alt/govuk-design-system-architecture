# GOV.UK Design System Architecture

We use this repository as a forum to discuss and record technical decisions that
affect the products supported by the GOV.UK Design System team, including:

- GOV.UK Design System
- GOV.UK Frontend
- GOV.UK Prototype Kit

This repository is open to enable involvement from the wider community and as a
reference for other teams within GDS and wider government.

There are 2 types of documentation:

- [Proposals](/proposals), often referred to as 'requests for comments', which
  allow us and the wider community to suggest and refine ideas.
- [Decision Records](/decision-records), which document decisions that have been
  made, along with any context.
