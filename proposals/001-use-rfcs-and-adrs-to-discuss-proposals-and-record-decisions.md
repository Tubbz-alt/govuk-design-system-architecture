# Use RFCs and ADRs to discuss proposals and record decisions

**Closing date:** 2018-03-16
**Status:** Proposed

## Summary

Use the Request for Comments (RFC) and Architecture Decision Record (ADR)
formats to discuss and record technical decisions for the products we support.

## Problem

We need to make and record decisions in the open, because:

- it will help us to answer questions from our users as to why things are the
  way they are
- it makes it less likely that approaches will be changed in the future without
  a full understanding of the context or the rationale for the original decision
- it provides a valuable resource to others, both in government and the wider
  community, who are embarking on similar projects

Whilst some of this is recorded in documents in e.g. Google Drive, this is
not publicly available; there is no consistent approach to how this
documentation is written; and there is no consistent approach to how it is
filed.

## Proposal

We will create a new public repository on GitHub
(`alphagov/govuk-design-system-architecture`) as a place to discuss proposals
and record decisions.

We will use a simplified version of the existing Request for Comments (RFC)
publication format as a platform for suggesting and refining ideas whilst
involving the wider community.

We will use the existing Architecture Decision Records (ADR) publication format
as a way to document decisions that have been made.

We will use markdown for both of these publication types.

We will aim to simplify the language where possible to reduce the barrier of
entry to contribution and involvement. For example, we will refer to RFCs as
proposals unless we are talking specifically about the format used; we will
simplify 'architecture decision records' to 'decision records'.
